#Recruitment task


Implement a clone of the Google calendar . Required features are:
 
- scheduling events: one-time / full day / recurring on different intervals (same intervals that Google is using)
- editing scheduled events (one-time events / event series / single event in a series)
- displaying events on a calendar control (both one-time events and event series infinitely in the future)
- sending reminder emails about upcoming tasks

If you’re unsure how something should work please reverse engineer Google calendar’s behavior (not code J) to figure out the correct requirements or ask if any clarification is needed.
